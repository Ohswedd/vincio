"""Agent-to-agent settlement & metering over the negotiated contract.

With cross-org sagas dispatching contracted work across organizations, the next
reach is **closing the books** on it: a metered, auditable settlement record for
work delivered under a negotiated :class:`~vincio.negotiation.Contract`, so a
cross-org engagement reconciles the way a run closes its cost report — never a
payment rail, only a verifiable ledger of what was owed and delivered.

* A :class:`Meter` accrues the **usage** of delivered work against the agreed
  price as a saga's steps complete — each unit a :class:`UsageEvent` attributed to
  the contract and the run — and rolls it up into a deterministic, total-preserving
  :class:`MeterReading`.
* A :class:`SettlementRecord` reconciles that delivery against the agreed
  price / SLA / quality into a typed, **signed, offline-verifiable** record: both
  parties sign one reconciliation hash, :meth:`SettlementRecord.verify` checks it
  from the bytes alone, and :func:`reconcile` ties two orgs' records out — a
  dispute is pinpointed, not merely flagged.
* A :class:`SettlementBook` is an org's durable, **hash-chained** ledger of those
  records — the settlement analogue of the
  :class:`~vincio.choreography.SagaJournal` — that :meth:`SettlementBook.verify`
  recomputes offline and :meth:`SettlementBook.report` rolls up per counterparty.
  Closing the books also **closes the reputation loop**: a settled overrun or
  shortfall debits the seller, so reliability earned in delivery weights the next
  negotiation.

:func:`settle_contract` settles one contract; :func:`settle_saga` settles every
contract a cross-org saga ran under, straight from its durable journal. Everything
is dependency-free, deterministic, and offline — never a hosted marketplace or a
payment processor, only a mechanical, verifiable reconciliation.
