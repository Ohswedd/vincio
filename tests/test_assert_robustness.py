"""Gate: ``-O`` robustness (vincio._assert_robustness).

Python strips every ``assert`` under ``python -O``. An ``assert`` that carries real
control-flow weight therefore *vanishes* in an optimized deployment, turning a caught
invariant into an opaque downstream error. The hardening line's 6.5 phase replaces
each such load-bearing ``assert`` with an explicit guard that raises the appropriate
:class:`~vincio.core.errors.VincioError`, and adds a lint
(:mod:`vincio._assert_robustness`) that holds the whole public tree to **zero**
unmarked ``assert``s: a genuine never-happens invariant kept as an ``assert`` carries
a justifying ``# noqa: S101``. This gate proves the tree is clean, proves the
detector bites, and proves two representative converted guards fire under the very
condition their stripped ``assert`` used to cover.
